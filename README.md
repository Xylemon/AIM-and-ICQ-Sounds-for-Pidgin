AIM and ICQ Sound Themes for Pidgin
===================================

Nostalgic sound themes for Pidgin users.

About
-----

These are two simple sound themes for Pidgin. 

As the name suggests, the sounds are taken from said programs and are 
attempted to be used appropriately.

Installation
------------

To install, simply place these folders into:

- Linux / Unix

	~/.purple/themes

- Windows

	%APPDATA%\.purple\themes

Then, select your sound theme under Pidgin's settings.

Notes
-----

- Not every sound had a proper Pidgin counter-part, so I applied  
  duplicates or other sounds despite their intended usage.
- ICQ sounds were grabbed from an install of version 99a.
- AIM sounds were grabbed from an install of version 1.0 and 5.0.
- The XML used for the themes is based on the Skype Sounds one by H (out 
  of laziness).
- I never used ICQ or AIM, or at least I don't have any memory of ever 
  using them.

Legal Warning
