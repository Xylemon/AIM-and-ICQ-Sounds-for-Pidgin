AIM and ICQ Sound Themes for Pidgin
-----------------------------------

These are two simple sound themes for Pidgin. As the name suggests, these sounds are taken from said programs and are attempted to be used appropriately.

Notes
-----

Not every sound has a proper Pidgin counter-part in the original programs, so I applied duplicates or other sounds despite their original usage.

ICQ sounds were grabbed from an install of version 99a.

AIM sounds were grabbed from an install of version 1.0 and a sound from version 5.0.

The XML used for the themes is based on the Skype Sounds one by H out of laziness.

I never used ICQ or AIM, or at least I don't have any memory of ever using them.

Legal Warning
-------------

All copyrighted material used belongs to their respected owners. None of the content here (images and sounds) belongs to me.

Distribution of these sounds is your call as it is unknown how either of the copyright holders legally feel about this pack.

I am not a lawyer and these are just here for fun and nostalgic purposes. Don't sue me!
